## 🚨 Problem Statement

In Morocco, **Centres de Santé** are the first point of care for many patients. However, these centers often lack advanced equipment and medical specialists. When a patient arrives with a **high or critical emergency**, they must be transferred to a **Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU)**.

### Current Challenges

* Emergency referrals are **manual** (phone calls, paperwork)
* No real-time visibility of **CHU capacity**
* Delays in **doctor assignment**
* No standardized digital patient handover

### Impact

* Increased response time for critical patients
* Higher risk during emergency transfers
* Poor coordination between health centers and CHUs

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We propose a **cloud-based SaaS emergency referral platform** that digitally connects **Centres de Santé** with **CHUs** to ensure fast, safe, and coordinated handling of critical patients.

### How It Works

1. Patient arrives at a Centre de Santé
2. Nurse registers patient and performs triage

5. A doctor accepts the case and prepares for patient arrival

### Key Features

* Rule-based emergency triage (AI-ready)
* Real-time referral to CHU
* Automatic doctor assignment
* Live notifications (WebSockets)
* Referral status tracking

### Why It Matters

* Reduces emergency response time
* Improves coordination between healthcare facilities
* Designed for low-resource environments
